# This project tries to randomize the result of the treasure island outcome
## -------------------------- GAME SUMMARY: ----------------------------------
This game tries to make decisions and the program decides the authenticity
of the answer by comparing the answer with a pre-generated value to determine
if the user gets to go the next stage of the game, or it's game over for the round.

The user tries to navigate between different levels. The game has 3 levels.
The first level ask the user for their direction.
The second level ask the user for their action based on the direction chosen.
The third level is the final stage where the user decides on a door to open.


The game doesn't have a predefined value as the correct answer is defined by
the program based on a value chosen from a random selection of the program.
